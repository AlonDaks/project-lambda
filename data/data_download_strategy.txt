Our project dataset requires downloading 20 .TGZ files, one per subject. Each 
.TGZ is 16 GBs. This file outlines how we plan on downloaded the data since that
itself is not trivial.

Each team member is tasked to download data for five subjects. Each subject
takes about 1.5 hours to download. Team members will place their downloaded 
.TGZs on an external hard-drive. Then, team members will meet in person to 
transfer .TGZs among each other. Each transfer takes less than 10 minutes, which
reduces the total download time from ~30 hours to ~10 hours. 

Once we everyone has all the data, we will unpack the .TGZs and see precisely 
which files we are going to use for our analysis. Keeping only the files we 
intend to use, we will upload the data to Google Drive. We will then write 
appropriate download scripts interfacing with the Google Drive data repository.

Below outlines which team member is responsible for downloading each subject's
.TGZ:

Alon: Subjects 1-5
Lisa: Subjects 6-10
Ying: Subjects 11-15
Jordeen: Subjects 16-20
